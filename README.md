# agatephone

Imagine a rotary phone whose base and handset are made mostly out of solid agate.

Now imagine this phone on a pedestal, surrounded by an ethereal glow.

First you're going to have to learn (or remember) how to dial a rotary phone.  Maybe you dial 0, which takes you "the operator".  Maybe you dial 666, which takes you...somewhere else. 

The creative details aren't all worked out yet.  The technical details are still in progress as well, but here's what's certain so far:


### Hardware

* Minimal Linux box w/ low power draw
* S100i (iaxy)
* rotary phone
* Bluetti EB3A power station
* small USB thermal printer


### Software

* Asterisk
* artery-thermal (github repo)
* generated voice prompts via OpenAI TTS


## Creative ideas

The phone is a "portal" into an unseeable pocket universe, with its own rules, values, and priorities...
